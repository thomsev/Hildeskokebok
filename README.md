## Technical Details

- **Framework:** The application is built using the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework for its efficient rendering and state management capabilities.
- **Styling:** For styling, [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) is used, which provides a range of responsive and customizable components.
- **Data Management:** Recipes are stored in a JSON file, which was created from the original Word document. This JSON file is then imported and rendered within the React application.
- **Hosting:** The application is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), offering seamless deployment and high performance.

## Features

- **Recipe Collection:** Users can browse through an array of recipes, each with detailed ingredients and instructions.
- **Responsive Design:** The site is fully responsive and can be viewed on various devices, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile.
- **Easy Navigation:** With a simple and intuitive UI, users can effortlessly navigate through the different sections of the cookbook.
